      title: "üìö My Fundamental Questions"
      subtitle: ""
      text: |-
        On top of my research interests, I am eager to see how the following questions will be answered.

        ---

        üß† **Consciousness**

        Core Question: Why are we conscious?

        - There‚Äôs no clear need for consciousness for the brain to function physically. So why does subjective experience arise at all?
        - How can we measure consciousness, if at all?
        - How do we know other people are conscious and not just behaving as if they are? (The problem of other minds)
        - Is our sense of continuous consciousness real, or just a cognitive illusion based on memory and narrative?

        ---

        ‚öõÔ∏è **Physics**

        Core Question: What is the fundamental theory of everything?

        - Will the ultimate theory be a single unifying framework, or a collection of effective theories that work in different domains?
        - Does causality emerge from deeper laws, or is it a built-in feature of the universe?
        - Is time an illusion, just another dimension rather than a flowing entity?

        ---

        ü§ñ **Intelligence**

        Core Question: What is intelligence?

        - What principles or architectures are required to build intelligence?
        - How can we define intelligence rigorously?
        - Can we create superhuman intelligence? If so, what would that mean for the uniqueness of human minds, and the possibility of other intelligent beings in the universe?
