  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

I am a Master's Student in Artificial Intelligence & Engineering Systems at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), doing my master's thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Devendra Dhami](https://sites.google.com/view/devendradhami). I completed my Bachelor of Science in Electrical & Electronic Engineering and minor in Physics at Yonsei University. Previously, I interned at [KAIST Visual AI Group](https://visualai.kaist.ac.kr) and [Kakao Mobility](https://www.kakaomobility.com).

My research focuses on building AI systems that generalize beyond their training data by learning structured and abstract representations. Unlike models that rely on surface-level correlations, I’m interested in approaches that capture underlying data-generating processes, such as causal relationships, compositional abstractions, and symbolic components to support robust, transferable, and explainable reasoning. Ultimately, my goal is to contribute toward AI systems capable of human-like reasoning: adaptable to new contexts, and capable of abstract inference.
